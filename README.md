## Rain - a Steam graphical assets builder üñºÔ∏èüèóÔ∏è

## Context

Publishing on the Steam Store requires a variety of assets and sizes, as described here https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets.

## Purpose

This tool makes preparing these assets a lot faster. Instead of using image editing software such as Photoshop to resize assets manually, you can resized versions of your asset in several clicks.

## Usage

For each size you'd like to prepare (e.g "Header Capsule"):

- Go to the container labeled "Header Capsule".
- Click on the first box to upload your asset.
- Move the resize box on top of your asset, to select which part of it should be fetched. You can scale your image (zoom in/out) with the mouse wheel.
- Click the "crop" button.
- Download your image from the preview section above the button.
